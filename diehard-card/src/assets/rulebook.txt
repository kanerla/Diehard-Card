Single-player Open-face Chinese Poker
Introduction
SPOFC is a variation of Open-face Chinese poker (OFC), which evolved from closed-face (“regular”) Chinese poker. It is not necessary to know the rules or strategies of regular Chinese poker or OFC in order to enjoy SPOFC.
The game is easy to learn and intuitive to play (don’t be scared by the table of bonuses), and like any good poker game, a beginner can win right away!
